        <h1>My mission is to provide the community a simple way to find events in and around the Tri-Cities area.</h1><!--mission statement-->
        <ol><!--the three goals of this website-->
            <li>Provide a single place to find events at multiple venues;</li>
            <li>Provie information a wide variety of events, from sports to concerts, and everything in-between;</li>
            <li>Work with smaller venues to help promote their events just as much as the bigger venues.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I dont' feel like there really is any website similar to what I am trying to do. The closest would be a ticketing site such as TicketMaster.
        The difference for my site would be that it isn't about just ticket events. It would be a way of bringing awareness to the unticketed events and smaller venues.
        It would be similar in that it would list shows and sporting events, where they are, the price if any cost, etc.
        </p><!--similar website-->
        <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/search?daterange=all&unit=miles&tab=events&sort=date%2Casc&radius=75&global=true">

        <p>I think that this website would work best as a single page.</p>
        <p>The page itself would be broken down into sections:
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>The first being "Up Coming Events, with all events, both ticketed and unticketed, being listed and able to be clicked on to take the user to the breakdown of the event.</li>
                <li>The next possibly being a more formal breakdown of these events, based on location and or whether they are ticketed, unticketed, or open to anyone.</li>
            </ul>
        </p><!--Website breakdown/how many pages it would be and how it would possibly be set-up-->
        <p>I think that the target audience for my website would be anyone in the Tri-Cities or anyone visiting the Tri-Cities looking for things to do or entertainment around town.</p>
        <p>For the most part, I believe the age range for this website would most likely be roughly 13 years old to late 40's early 50's with no gender discrepancy. My hope would be to make it as user friendly as possible so that anyone could use the site.</p><!--target audience-->
